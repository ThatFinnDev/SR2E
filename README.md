# SR2Essentials
 A mod for SlimeRancher 2 that adds a ModMenu to the Main Menu and a InGameConsole with commands (expandable by other mods).

 # Installation:
  1. Install MelonLoader 0.6.1 https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/tag/v0.6.1
  2. Download the SR2Essentials.dll in the releases Tab.
  3. Put the SR2Essentials.dll in your Mods Folder
  4. If you have the old ModMenu.dll, then remove it.

# Usage:
 Open the console wih Ctrl+Tab

# API
 See wiki

# Known bugs:
 Sometimes the consoles doesn't recognize keyboard or mouse scroll input, this is due to the input I had to disable for the game. This is done very crudely at moment and I had to write my own workaround which causes this behaviour sometimes. It's easily fixable by closing and reopening the console

 Sometimes the opening/closing of the console can freeze the game. This also fixable by closing and reoping the console.

# TODO:
 Fix console breaking game while ModMenu/Map is open
 -> Temporary fix: Stop console from opening while these menus are open

 AutoComplete for Commands
 -> Not Implemented, Still thinking about a good way to implement this
